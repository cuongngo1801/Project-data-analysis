# Project-data-analysis
Take a feature of the start meal base on Insulin data file. And make a cluster using K-mean and DBSCAN
Turn on a file train.py to get a feature when the meal is start.
After that. Open a file test.py to get a result (How many the meal is start base on a time)
Run result.py file to take a 1x6 vector contain SSE for Kmean. SSE for DBSCAN, Entropy for K-mean. Entropy for DBSCAN. Purity for Kmean. Purity for BDSCAN.
